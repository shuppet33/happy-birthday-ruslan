Hi! This is a little quest game for my friend Ruslan in honor of his birthday.

It is a visual novel with mini-games.:

1. Get Ruslan ready for college
2. College programming class (5 tasks of varying difficulty)
3. College Security Class (protect your computer)
4. College class in higher mathematics (yes, yes, I love my friend)
5. Fix the bug on Alyona's computer

All these main games open hints to the location of gifts in the apartment.
